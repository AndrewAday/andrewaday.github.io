# Welcome!

Hello, my name is Andrew Aday. I am a programmer, pianist, and computer musician. I graduated from Columbia University in 2018 with a BS in computer science, and until recently worked at Instagram as a software engineer. I am now exploring new aesthetic possibilities within computer music, and have made this site to showcase my recent projects.
